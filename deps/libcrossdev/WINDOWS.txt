To compile on windows we use VC10 and cygwin with make.
Copy cl.bat and lib.bat from cygwin_wrappers to a directory in your path in
cygwin, e.g., in /usr/local/bin, and make sure that the MSVC compiler is in your
path. For example, add it with the following:
PATH="/cygdrive/c/Program Files/Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0/VC/bin/":$PATH
export PATH

We also assume that the environment variable $VS100COMNTOOLS exists. We use that
to locate the vsvars32.bat file that sets up the build environment.
